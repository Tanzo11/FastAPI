FastAPI.jpg contains the diagramatic workflow of the project.

We will up the docker and run the nykaa.py file to scrape the data which gets stored into the postgres container database.
Then we will run the generalise.py to fetch the data from the container database and store the generalised data into the container datbase.

Then we are ready to fully use all the functionalities of the API.
